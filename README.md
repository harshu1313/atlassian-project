# atlassian-project


Our Atlassian clone project is a testament to our commitment to providing a familiar project management and collaboration experience. Developed exclusively with pure HTML and CSS, we've painstakingly recreated the core features of Atlassian's suite of tools, including Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket.
However, it's important to acknowledge that our clone is not responsive, meaning it's designed primarily for desktop or larger screens. While our dedication to utilizing HTML and CSS showcases our development skills, we recognize that the lack of responsiveness may limit user accessibility, particularly on mobile devices.
Rest assured, we are committed to continually improving our clone to deliver the best possible experience within the confines of our chosen technologies. We understand the importance of user accessibility, and we will explore ways to enhance the responsiveness of our clone in future iterations. Our goal is to provide a seamless and intuitive project management solution for users across a variety of devices.
